Local Storage I
Write a simple component that returns a JSX input field of type text. Users can interact with the input field to type in any string they want. Youâ€™re meant to store this string in local storage so that every time when the page reloads it pre-fills the input field with the latest known value for the users.


Directions
Do not edit the data-testid attributes
Use the reload button in the demo browser to test if your component works as expected.
You can import any methods from the react library.
