###Camelise object

Write a function camelise(obj) that takes an object as input and returns a new object with all the keys in the camel case notation. The function should assume that all the keys in the input object are in snake case notation. The function should work with objects that contain multiple nested objects and arrays.


The function should not modify the original object and should return a new object with the camel case keys. The function should work with all valid objects and should handle edge cases such as empty objects, objects with empty values, and objects with null or undefined values.


Directions
All the keys in the input object are in snake_case
The input object can have many nested objects
If the input object is empty, then return an empty object
